# Contact Sharing App

A simple contact-sharing app built using **Flutter (GETX)** and **Flask**.  
Created almost a year ago during a free weekend not my best work.

## Features

- 🔍 Search for other users and visualize their contact cards  
- ➕ Follow users and send messages  
- 🖼️ Set profile pictures and customize contact cards  
- 💬 Messaging via REST polling (not optimal)  
- 🌐 Public user pages rendered on the backend using Jinja templates

## Notes

- Messaging is based on periodic polling rt updates are **not** supported.
- The project was more of a weekend experiment than a production ready app.
