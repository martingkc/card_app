Simple Contact sharing app made using Flutter (GETX) and Flask.
Made it almost a year ago on a free weekend. Not my best. 

Users can search for other users, follow them and message them. Each user can set their profile pictures and customize their cards to their liking. The messaging is done through rest polling so not optimal at all.
